baseline: {Temperature: lag 12}

OG_lags: {Temperature: 1-12 + 24 + 36, soil_temperature_layer_1: lag 12}

Reduced_lags: {Temperature: 1 + 6 + 12, soil_temperature_layer_1: lag 12}

Anom_lags: {Temperature: 1-12 + 24 + 36, soil_temperature_layer_1: lag 12}


Changes:

For the baseline model, I am removing the simulation portion, since there is 
realistically no need for this. The model is only being trained on L12, hence, 
I don't believe there is a need of creating the simulations since the model wont
use any of the simulated lags within a < 1 year time span. 
-->  By removing the simulation loops, I am simply predicting directly from 
the model's distributional output and then calculating quantile scores against 
the observed data (for the years where you have actual data).
Thus, quantile derivation changed from a stochastic approximation to a 
deterministic calculation.

We are also increasing the number of lags
